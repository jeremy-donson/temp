## Project Justifications
+ [Github speaks quite lucidly](https://help.github.com/articles/about-readmes/) about README's, repository licenses, contribution guidelines, and codes of conduct.
- README docs tend to be about WHAT and HOW. Justifications regard "WHY". Well, WHY WHAT?
- [What ARE Git and Github?]()
- [What ARE Open Source and Linux?]()
- [Why Should I Care?]()
- [Why Are READMEs Important?]()
- [Why Are READMEs Important To Whom?]()
- [Are All READMEs Rated The Same Way?]()
- [What makes READMEs Effective?]()
- [How Do READMEs Design Goals Vary?]()
- [How many kinds of READMEs Are There?]()
- [Practical Justifications]()
- [Ethical Justifications]()

## Beginner Use-Cases


And that is what this work IS.
Save others time, and they are to do the same in kind.

I like that ethic, both personally and professionally.
Instead, for everyone to be wasting time, each with their own version of the exact same problem?  NO thx!~ . 😀
